# PathFindingVisualization

This is an application through which users can view the search algorithm of the shortest path between two points.

We will assume that the "cost" between two roads is equal to 1, for a simpler visualization of the Dijkstra algorithm.

A short demo can be found [here](https://youtu.be/weGWjPGjsPU).
